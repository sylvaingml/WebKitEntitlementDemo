# WebKitEntitlementDemo

Ultra simple demo app using WKWebView.

This simple example is used to show proper entitlements to be used with sandboxing on macOS.

Go back in history to get initial version without sandboxing.

Latest version has sandbox enabled. And proper entitlement for network connection set.
